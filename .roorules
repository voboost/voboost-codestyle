# Voboost Code Style - Project Intelligence

## Global Rules Distribution (CRITICAL)
- ALL Voboost projects MUST include common rules from /Users/vitaly/voboost/voboost-codestyle/.clinerules
- Project-specific rules should be added to individual project .clinerules files
- This ensures consistency across the entire Voboost ecosystem

## Language Policy (CRITICAL)
- ALL code comments MUST be in English
- ALL documentation MUST be in English
- ALL variable names, function names, class names MUST be in English
- ALL error messages MUST be in English
- Configuration VALUES can support multiple languages including Russian
- This policy is documented in memory bank and must be maintained

## Naming Convention (CRITICAL)
- Project name is ALWAYS "Voboost" (not "VoBoost")
- Use "Voboost" in all documentation, comments, and user-facing text
- This applies to titles, headers, and any references to the project name

## Code Style Rules (CRITICAL)
- ALL source code files MUST end with a blank line to avoid "No newline at end of file" warnings in diffs
- This applies to .kt, .java, .yaml, .md and all other text files
- Always add empty line at the end when creating or modifying files
- NO EMOJI in any files - use plain text only for all documentation and code

## Universal Project Patterns

### Code Organization
- All public API methods return Result<T> for consistent error handling
- Never throw exceptions in public API
- Use nullable properties for graceful missing value handling

### File Structure
- Memory bank documentation in memory-bank/ directory
- All build files use Kotlin DSL (.gradle.kts) when possible

### Testing Approach
- Unit tests for all core functionality
- Test resources in src/test/resources/
- Aim for high coverage of public API

### Documentation Standards
- KDoc comments for all public APIs
- Comprehensive README.md with usage examples
- Implementation details in separate technical docs
- Memory bank for development context

## Development Workflow
- Memory bank MUST be updated when discovering new patterns
- All project information MUST be stored in memory bank, not in separate files
- All changes should maintain backward compatibility
- Unit tests must pass before any commits

## Information Management Rules
- NEVER create separate documentation files outside memory bank
- All technical details, implementation notes, and project updates go in memory-bank/
- Use memory bank files for all project knowledge preservation
- Keep external files minimal and focused only on immediate technical needs

## Code Style Integration
- This repository provides centralized code style configuration for all Voboost projects
- Use symlinks to distribute .editorconfig to maintain single source of truth
- ktlint 1.0.1 for Kotlin formatting and linting
- EditorConfig for IDE integration
- Consistent formatting across all projects in Voboost ecosystem
